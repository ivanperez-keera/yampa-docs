# Yampa Documents

This repo contains documentation related to Yampa: papers, images, links,
tutorials, etc.

At the present time, it contains diagrams created by Antony Courtney.

_Note: It is likely that the repo will not be kept for long, since keeping binary
files in git, especially files that were generated from other files, is
probably a bad idea._
